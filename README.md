## Dynamic Connectivity

This is an implementation of Holm et al.'s data structure for dynamic
connectivity. 

Full details of the data structure may be found in their paper titled
[_Poly-Logarithmic Deterministic Fully-Dynamic Algorithms for Connectivity,
Minimum Spanning Tree, 2-Edge, and
Biconnectivity_](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.89.919&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

(Spring 2012) â€” Lecture 20: Dynamic Graphs
